# 1.4 Check Permutation

Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other

## Assumptions
- Uppercase and lowercase characters not distinct, and spaces are treated as a distinct character.
- Two empty strings should return true; one empty string will return false compared to any other string
- The string input length has a reasonable upper bound
