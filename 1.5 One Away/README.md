# 1.5 One Away

There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away. 

## Assumptions
- Uppercase and lowercase characters are distinct. For example, Bear is not equal to bear
- Two empty strings should return true; one empty string should return true of the other string is empty or a single letter
- The string does not contain any spaces or special characters
- If the strings match, return true
- The string input length has a reasonable upper bound
