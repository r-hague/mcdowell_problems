# 1.4 Palindrome Permutation

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutations of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to dictionary words. 

## Assumptions
- Uppercase and lowercase characters not distinct, and spaces can be ignored.
- An empty string should return true
- The string input length has a reasonable upper bound
