# 1.3 URLify

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are give the "true" length of the string. 

## Assumptions
- The method should replace multiple spaces with a single "%20" and remove leading and trailing spaces
- An empty string should return an empy string
- The string input length has a reasonable upper bound
