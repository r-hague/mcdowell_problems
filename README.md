# Introduction
This working repository contains subfolders with my worked solutions to the problems presented in in the book *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (6th edition, Â©2015).

Each folder, identified by the chapter, problem number, and short problem name, contains the solution to the corresponded problem written in JavaScript. In general, each soltuion includes one or more functions to solve the problem and a short suite of tests to ensure that the code behaves as expected. It also has a README file detailing the exact problem wording, and the assumptions that I made while solving it. No front-end interface or I/O components are included except where explicitly required. 



# To get started
1. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install any dependencies
2. Run `npm test` to run the test suite, which should result in an "all passing" response
